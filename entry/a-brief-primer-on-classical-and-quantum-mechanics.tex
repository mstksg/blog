Okay! In this series we will be going over many subjects in both physics
and computational techniques, including the Lagrangian formulation of
classical mechanics, basic principles of quantum mechanics, the Path
Integral formatulion of quantum mechanics, the Metropolis-Hastings Monte
Carlo method, dealing with entropy and randomness in a pure language,
and general principles in numerical computation! Fun stuff, right?

The end product will be a tool for deriving the ground state probability
distribution of arbitrary quantum systems, which is somewhat of a big
deal in any field that runs into quantum effects (which is basically
every modern field). But the real goal will be to hopefully impart some
insight that can be applied to broarder and more abstract applications.
I am confident that these techniques can be applied to many problems in
computation to great results.

I'm going to assume little to no knowledge in Physics and a somewhat
intermediate working knowledge of programming. We're going to be working
in both my favorite imperative language and my favorite functional
language.

In this first post I'm just going to go over the basics of the physics
before we dive into the simulation. Here we go!

\section{Classical Mechanics}\label{classical-mechanics}

\subsection{Newtonian Mechanics}\label{newtonian-mechanics}

Mechanics has always been a field in physics that has held a special
place in my heart. It is most likely the field most people are first
exposed to in a physics course. To me, there really is no more
fundamental and pure form of physics. I mean\ldots{}it's the study of
how things move under forces. How can you get any deeper to the heart of
physics than that?

When most people think of mechanics, they think of \(F = m a\), inertia,
and that every reaction has an equal and opposite re-action. These are
Newton's ``Laws of Motion'' and they provide what can be referred to as
a ``state-updating function'': Given a state of the world at time
\(t_0\), Newton's laws can be used to ``generate'' the state of the
world at time \(t_0 + \Delta t\).

This sounds pretty useful, but it wasn't long before physicists began
wishing they had other tools with which to study the mechanics of
certain systems. Newton's equations worked very well for the cases that
made it famous, but were surprisingly unuseful, impractical, or clumsy
in many others. And when we talk about relativity, where things like
\(\Delta t\) can't even be trivially defined, it is almost completely
useless without complicated modifications.

So it was almost exactly one hundred years after Newton's laws that two
people named
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange}{Lagrange} and
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler}{Euler} (who is the
``e'' in \(e\)) followed a wild hunch that ended up paying off.

\subsection{Lagrangian Mechanics}\label{lagrangian-mechanics}

To understand Lagrangian Mechanics, we must abandon our idea of
``force'' as the fundamental phenomenon. Instead of forces, we deal with
``potential fields''.

You can imagine potential fields as a roller coaster track, or as a
landscape of rolling grassy hills. The height of a track or a landscape
at that point corresponds to the value of the potential at that point.
Potential fields work like this: Every object ``wants'' to go
\emph{downwards} in a potential field --- it will want to go in the
direction (backwards/forwards for the roller coaster,
north/south/east/west for the hilly landscape) that will take it
downwards. We don't care why, or how --- it just ``wants'' to. And the
steeper the downwardness, the greater the compulsion.

We call this potential field \(U(\vec{r})\), which means ``\(U\) at the
point \(\vec{r}\)''. (\(\vec{r}\) denotes a point in space)

Relating this to \(F = m a\), the force on the object is now equal to
the steepness of the potential field at the point where the object is,
and in the direction that would allow the object to go downwards in
potential. Objects always wish to minimize their potential, and do so as
fast as they can. In mathematical terminology, we say that
\(F(\vec{r}) = - \vec{\nabla} U(\vec{r})\).

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includegraphics{/img/entries/path-integral-intro/gradient.png}
\caption{Top-down view of the potential in the previous figure,
overlayed with arrows indicating the direction and magnitude of
\(F(\vec{r})\).}
\end{figure}

Now, for Lagrangian Mechanics:

Let's say I tell you an object's location at time \(t_0\), and its
location later at time \(t_1\), and the potential energy field. What
path did that object take to get from point A to point B?

A pretty open question, right? You don't really have that much
information to go off of. You just know point A and point B. It could
have taken any path, for all we know! If we only knew \(F = m a\), not
only would we be at a complete loss at how to even start, but we
wouldn't even know if there was only one or even a hundred valid paths a
particle could have taken.

The solution to this problem is actually rather unexpected. Consider
every single path/curve from point A to point B. Every single one. Now,
assign each path a number known as the \textbf{Action}:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For every point, add up the ``Kinetic Energy'' at that point, which,
  for classical mechanics, is the square of the object's speed
  multiplied by \(\frac{1}{2} m\).
\item
  For every point, add up \(U(\vec{r})\) at that point.
\item
  Subtract (2) from (1).
\end{enumerate}

Think about every possible path. Calculate the action for each one. The
path that the object takes is \emph{the path with the lowest action}

It's almost as if the object ``does the math'' in its head: ``I'm going
to go from here to there\ldots{}let me calculate which path I can take
has the lowest action. Okay, got it!''

Lagrangian Mechanics provides for us a way to find out just what path an
object must have taken to get from point A to point B.

As it turns out, looking at things this way opens up entire worlds of
understanding. For example, just from this, we find that \emph{total
energy is conserved} over time for a closed system (trust me on this;
the calculus is slightly tricky). We also have a formulation that works
fine under Special Relativity in all frames of reference with almost no
tweaks. And yes, if you actually do find the path of lowest action, the
path will somehow magically always follow the state-updating equations
\(F = m a\). It's just now we have a much more insighftul and meaningful
way to look at the universe:

Paths \textbf{always attempt to minimize their action}.

Okay. We don't have that much time to spend on this, or its
philosophical implications, so we're going to move on now to Quantum
Mechanics.

\section{Quantum Mechanics}\label{quantum-mechanics}

\subsection{Schrödinger Formulation}\label{schruxf6dinger-formulation}

If there was one thing that ``everyone'' knew about quantum mechanics,
it would either be
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr\%C3\%B6dinger's_cat}{Scrödinger's
Cat} or the fact that objects are no longer ``for sure'' anywhere. They
are only \emph{probably} somewhere.

How can we then analyze the behavior of \emph{anything}? If everything
is just a probability, and nothing is certain, we can't really use the
same ``state-updating functions'' that we used to rely on, because the
positions and velocities of the objects in question don't even have
well-defined values.

Physicists' first solutions involved creating a new ``state'' that did
not involve particles at all. This ``state'' described the state of the
universe, but not in terms of particles and positions and velocities. It
is a new \emph{abstract} state. Then, they invented the equivalent of an
\(F = m a\) for this abstract state --- an equation that, for every
abstract state at time \(t_0\), gives you the abstract state at time
\(t_0 + \Delta t\).

This approach is useful\ldots{}just like \(F = m a\) was useful. But it
inherits all of the problems of \(F = m a\). How can we apply what we
learned about actions and Lagrangian mechanics to Quantum Mechanics? How
do we make Lagrangian mechanics ``quantum''?

\subsection{Path Integral Formulation}\label{path-integral-formulation}

The answer is a bit simple, actually.

Instead of saying ``the object will chose the path with the least
action'', we say \textbf{the object chooses a random path, choosing
lower-action paths more often}. That is, if an electron is shot from
point A to point B, the electron picks a random path from point A to
point B. It is a \emph{weighted random choice} based on the action of
each path --- if Path \(\alpha\) has lower action than Path \(\beta\),
the electron will pick path \(\alpha\) more often than path \(\beta\).

There are some small technical differences (the process of calculating
the action is slightly different, and you end up summing over complex
numbers for certain reasons), but the fundamental principle remains the
same.

So say we have an electron floating around a hydrogen atom (a hydrogen
atom creates a very pretty and easy to work with potential field). We
know it is at point A at time \(t_0\), and point B at time \(t_1\). What
path did the electron take to get there?

Simple: We don't know. But we can say that it \emph{probably} took the
path with the least action. It \emph{could have also} taken the path
with the \emph{second to least} action\ldots{}but that's just slightly
less likely. It \emph{probably did not} take the path with the greatest
action\ldots{}but who knows --- it might have! It's like it rolls a dice
to determine which path it goes on, but the dice is weighted so that
lower-action paths are rolled more often than higher-action paths.

The electron \emph{wants} to take the lowest-action path\ldots{}but
sometimes decides not to.

So now we see what Lagrangian Mechanics in classical mechanics really
\emph{is}: It's quantum mechanics, except that the lowest-action path is
\emph{so much likelier} than any other path that we almost never see the
second-to-least action path taken.

As it turns out, like Lagrangian mechanics opened eyes to new worlds in
classical mechanics, the Path Integral formulation\footnote{Why is it
  called the ``Path Integral'' formulation? When we add up something at
  every single point on a path, we are mathematically perfoming a ``Path
  Integral''. So Path Integral Formulation means ``physics based on the
  adding up stuff for every point on a path''.} of quantum mechanics
opened up totally new worlds that the previous ``state updating
formula'' approach could have never dreamed of.

\section{Implications}\label{implications}

Okay, so what does this all have to do with us?

How many processes do we know that can be modeled by something trying to
minimize itself, but not always succeeding? What data patterns can be
unveiled by modeling things this way?

I'll leave this question slightly open-ended, but I'm also going to hint
at the next installment's contents.

\subsection{Particle in a potential}\label{particle-in-a-potential}

Let's go back again to our electron next to an atom. Let's say that this
electron will move around and return back to its current position at
time \(t_0 + \Delta t\), for very large \(\Delta t\). From what we
learned, this electron can really take any path it wants, going anywhere
in the universe and back again. Any closed loop that that zig zags or
curls anywhere is a valid path.

We can ``pick'' a random path, weighted by the action, and see where the
electron goes in that path. See where we find the electron along points
in the path. After many picks, we start seeing where the electron is
``most likely to be''. We find the probability distribution of an
electron in that potential.

We now have a way, given any quantum potential, to find the probability
distribution of a particle in that potential.

From here we can also find the particle's average energy, and many other
properties of a particle given an arbitrary quantum potential.

Now let's implement it.
